# WavyBirds
- Textures made with [pixilart](www.pixilart.com).
- Code can be found in the [WavyBirds/Code](https://github.com/JonathanBout/WavyBirds/tree/master/WavyBirds/Code) folder, textures in the [WavyBirds/Images](https://github.com/JonathanBout/WavyBirds/tree/master/WavyBirds/Images) folder.

## How the game works
- Flappy Bird-ish game.
- Every bird is a 'life'. If you hit a bar you lose one bird, but if you hit the ground you lose all.
- Play!
 <br><br>oh and btw there is one ~bug~ feature that allows you to go on forever :)
